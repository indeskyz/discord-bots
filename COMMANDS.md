### What's this for?

This bot is used for an incentive for when a user boosts the discord server

When a user boosts the server, they will be rewarded with a custom command in the form of _/<username_of_booster>_
This command can be something simple like a message or it can be something more complex like a message card that displays their social media links, artwork, portfolios, etc.
